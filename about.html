      <p>Hi, my name is Michael. When I was young, I began to learn programming languages such as GW-Basic, D-Base and Cobol with an 8-bit computer. Because I was young, it was difficult to fully understand what I learned, but I was able to develop logical thinking skills through understanding algorithms. During my university years, I studied mechanical engineering as a primary major, and learned programming languages such as C and Matlab for mechatronics and robotics. After that, I studied computer science as my second major. After graduating from university, I started to work as a mechanical engineer. I have worked in oil and gas industry for more than 13 years, including two years of Canadian experience. I have come to the turning point of my life through immigration to Canada and now I am looking for a challenging opportunity in the IT field.</p>
      <p>As a self-motivated, helpful, and flexible associate who knows what is needed to get the job done I am sure that I can be an asset.  I am both persuasive and capable of developing rapport and trust, as well as experienced in influencing the attitudes of others.</p>
      <p>I am now looking for my new adventure, so feel free to browse the projects section to check out what I have built, shoot me an <a class="about_me_links" href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email</a> or connect on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinbong//">linkedIn</a>.</p>
