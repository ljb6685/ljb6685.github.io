      <p>My name is Michael. At a young age I learned programming languages such as Cobol, D-Base and GW-Basic. Through understanding algorithms, I developed logical thinking skills early on. I studied Mechanical Engineering and learned programming languages such as C and MATLAB for mechatronics and robotics. As my second major, I studied computer science. I have worked in the oil and gas industry from more than 13 years including two years in Calgary. I am now a Canadian resident and I am looking for a challenging opportunity in the IT field.</p>
      <p>I am mature and self-motivated professional with extensive experience and technical training in developing web applications to meet evolving business needs. My experience has taught me how to “get the job done” in a team environment. I am sure that I can be an asset in most situations given my hands-on experience, my ability to work well with others and a relentless completion and follow up attitude.</p>
